# graphfruit
**graphfruit** is a small graph library written in C++ that provides generic data structures and algorithms. It was created to learn basic C++ and to improve my knowledge in graph theory.

### Data structures:

* Graph
* Digraph
* Union-find
* Fibonacci heap

### Example algorithms:

* Bellman-Ford shortest path
* Cycle detection
* Dijkstra's shortest path
* Johnson's all shortest paths
* K-core decomposition
* Khan's topological sorting
* Kruskal's minimum spanning tree
* Longest path in DAGs
* Prim's minimum spanning tree
* Tarjan's strongly connected components
* Transpose of directed graph
